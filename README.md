pull data from wunderground

Thanks for the r package weatherData, rwunderground, I used to pull weather data very easily. 
While, it seems these packages don't work well as previously since there's some changes on wunderground.com.

This script is used pull multiple days weather data for selected cities.

*With a free wunderground API key, it allows 500 calls per day and 10 calls per minute. If exceeded, a "raindrop" is count down from the account.

*Register an API key on https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api
